# Lung_Cancer_Detection
Lung cancer is a critical health concern worldwide, with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and data science techniques offer promising avenues for developing predictive models. In this project, we aim to leverage data science methodologies to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on relevant features. The dataset used encompasses information from both male and female individuals, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of gender-specific patterns.


 Attribute information points:

Age: Age of the individual.

Gender: Gender of the participant (Categorical: Male or Female).

Smoking_Status: Smoking history categorized as "Current Smoker," "Former Smoker," or "Non-Smoker."

Occupational_Exposure: Information about exposure to occupational hazards related to lung cancer risk.

Genetic_Markers: Presence or absence of specific genetic markers associated with lung cancer (Binary: Yes/No).

Family_History: History of lung cancer in the individual's family (Binary: Yes/No).

Chest_Xray_Results: Findings from chest X-ray examinations (Categorical: Normal, Abnormal).

CT_Scan_Results: Detailed information from computed tomography scans, including the presence of lung nodules or masses (Categorical: Normal, Abnormal).

CEA_Levels: Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels (Continuous).

CYFRA_21_1_Levels: Cytokeratin Fragment (CYFRA 21-1) levels (Continuous).

Lung_Cancer_Diagnosis: Binary variable indicating whether the individual has been diagnosed with lung cancer (Binary: Yes/No).
